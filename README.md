# Predicting-RDU-Departures

Flying has always been stressful, and even more so in our post-covid world. These days it seems like flying has gotten worse: more delayed/cancelled flights, more missed connections, more lost luggage, and far worse airline customer service than previously. And flights are more expensive than ever!

I hope to alleviate at least one piece of the puzzle: delays and cancellations. I created a model that predicts whether flights leaving Raleigh-Durham airport in North Carolina will be on time, delayed by less than 1 hour, less than 2 hours, more than 2 hours, or cancelled (a multiclass classification model). My random forest classifier model had the following metrics on the test set:
Accuracy: 0.89
Precision: 0.89
Recall: 0.89
F1-Score: 0.89
ROC-AUC score: 0.96

Travellers in the RDU area will be able to use the tool to decide whether or not to book certain flights and airlines on certain days of the week, month, and year to selected destinations. Travel agencies booking from the RDU airport will also be able to take this into consideration. Hopefully having this tool will ameliorate some of the unavoidable stress of flying! 

With more widespread use airlines and the RDU airport might be held accountable for their delays/cancellations.
